clinks -- Manage your bookmarks online

* Introduction
Clinks is a web app made to manage your bookmarks. It is mostly
inspired by [[http://delicious.com][delicious]].
* Features
Right now, clinks includes the following features:
  - Tag support, research by tag
  - Editing/deleting links
  - Import of delicious/firefox bookmarks
  - Simple API, inspired by delicious' API

Socials features like seeing each others bookmarks, suggestions
etc. are planned.
* Installation
Clinks depends on the following libraries:
  - alexandria
  - split-sequence
  - cl-who
  - hunchentoot
  - clsql
  - ironclad
  - drakma
  - cl-ppcre

Each of these libraries are available through [[http://www.quicklisp.org/][quicklisp]] or
[[http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install][asdf-install]].

To install clinks, just clone the git repository, load the system and call
=start=. The default port is set to 8000 and the default database type
is sqlite3[fn:sqlite].

[fn:sqlite] Note that clsql's sqlite backend is bugged, it doesn't
auto increment primary keys, see the patch [[http://lists.b9.com/pipermail/clsql/2008-August/001616.html][here]].
